Justification and Recommendation
Jira and Blueprint RCM are chosen for the start up team’s management over the project. Jira is a cloud-based SaaS tool. Jira is an easy to use project management tool and it has lots of effective tools. With Jira scheduling and tracking is easy and comfortable. However, once AD is restored from backup, it must be restarted, additionally, its pricing is high, which is $120 for a year. Blueprint RCM is another cloud-based SaaS solution for managing a project, supporting almost all browsers. It is a useful management, collaboration and documenting tool. One of the most comfortable sides of the Blueprint RCM is the availability of automatic generation of user stories and test cases. However, not all functionalities and features are completely user friendly. Membership costs $80.
New start up of mobile applications development is recommended Jira project management tool. Because it is more suitable for this kind of business as it is more user friendly and has a variety of efficient tools.

For designing and prototyping, Canva, Wireframe.cc, InVision Studio and Adobe Photoshop are found to be competitive tools. Canva is a famous, easy to use and user-friendly cloud-based SaaS solution that is widely used by graphic designers and bloggers. Its functions are easy to understand and implement. Basic plan is free, premium is $12.95 for a month. Prototyping tools’ options inside Canva are so wide, that a designer probably uses almost all functions. However, in the free version naturally there is a limit for most of the functions which are available for premium users. Wireframe.cc is another cloud-based designing tool. With the help of Wireframe.cc, website layouts can be created and show what interface has to the main page. The tool is easily accessed and its interface is clean and easily can be understood. However, the tool has no drag and drop functions, which usually users find comfortable, also there is no feedback management. Wireframe.cc costs $16 per month. Next, InVision Studio is an on-premise based software tool that supports Mac. Wide range of functionality allows users to collaborate easily during the designing and prototyping process. Creating live prototyping is easy and fast. However, disadvantages are that it has no versions for Windows and poor support of users in terms of communication. The monthly use costs $15. One of the most popular designing tools is Adobe Photoshop that is supported in Mac and Windows. This tool is mostly used for editing photos and graphic designing. Upward of the program are that can be used while there is no internet connection and easy to use functionalities. Disadvantages of the Adobe Photoshop are it is highly priced and some functionalities may be out of reach.
After analyzing various designing tools, Canva has more upward sides compared to other tools. Because, its functionalities are useful, user-friendly and easy to understand. Thus, Canva is recommended for start up for mobile applications development.

From testing tools, the strongest 2 tools are selected namely Appium and Selendroid. Appium is a free testing tool for cross-platforms, which can test IOS and Android. Appium was developed by Dan Ceullar in 2011. Most favorable sides of the Appium are that it supports various programming languages and JSON wire. But, testing is slowly progressing and not all Android versions can be tested. Selendroid is another popular testing tool that is open source. Selendroid fully supports JSON wire and can be interacted with multiple Android devices.
